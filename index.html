				<h2 class="section-dis">Status</h2>
				<p>I'm currently attending Code Louisville to build relevant skills in web design and programing. While web design is interesting enough I find programing to be enjoyable to play around with and figure out. This page is a repository to display the various little things I develop.</p>

				<h2 class="section-dis">Text based Web RPG</h2>
				<p> In highschool I played quite a few different text based browser games including RPGs. I thought this would be a good initial project because I'd be able to find a place to use just about anything I learned in javascript.<br><br>

				The baseline project is now finished. It features a character creation and display, a shop and shopping cart feature, a navigation process, a basic quest system, a basic leveling system, and random encounter / combat mechanic. Everything is streamlined well enough that adding new content(areas, items, monsters, quests, etc.) is the work of minutes.<br><br>

				There is room for improvement here with a more involved leveling system, skills, classes, pictures, etc. This can be taken care of fairly simply as I've developed the required skills in the process of putting together everything else.</p>

				<p> This is a bunch of filler text in order to test formatting. I could have grabbed some filler latin but decided against it.</p>
